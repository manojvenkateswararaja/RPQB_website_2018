                                                        Is BlockChain going to be a mere data repository of live data with some

                                                        So, from a corporate sector view of the adoption of Blockchain, the
                                                        challenge is to convince the sector on the added layers of security the

                                                        Here in India, the Central Government and most of the State Governments
                                                        are promoting BlockChain Technology among various Govt establishments &

                                                        possibilities of this technology. The concern for them is that this
                                                        technology is something very new, something which is not proven and

                                                        securest way to store and access data. So, the need is for a clearer
