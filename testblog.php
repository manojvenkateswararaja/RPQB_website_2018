                     “Can I verify who you say you are?” is the most common question used by businesses for validating customers in the real world.

“How can I trust you will handle my personal details with utmost privacy?” is the question back to these businesses from real people.

                         <p>
                         How do we have a decentralised system that satisfies the authentication needs of businesses and the privacy needs of individuals?

Unique IDentification Authority of India (UIDAI), an agency established by the Government of India has been successful in collecting and storing securely the personal details and biometrics of 1.25 billion residents with a unique ID, Aadhaar. It offered online, real-time authentication by multiple means (fingerprint, iris and OTP) to businesses and government agencies.

                     Ever since Bitcoin, the world of cryptocurrency had grown rapidly. Investors particularly from financial background shown immense interest in creating new cryptocurrencies and launching ICO. For a period of time, almost every single day there was at least one ICO launch in the market. Open source blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, NEM etc helped these investors to launch ICOs without any hassle.
