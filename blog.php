                                            That raises the question of how Blockchain can be a selling point to
                                            5million users when the awareness about this emerging technology is
                                            just happening and more importantly, what is the USP of availing global
                                            health care services (or any other service) from a BlockChain
                                            application?</p>
                                        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="smallheading">
                                            Is BlockChain going to be a mere data repository of live data with some
                                            high degree of security & protection or will it remain as a reference
                                            point only or would such Blockchain applications truly allow the user
                                            to do a real-time transaction wherein s/he can witness the process and
                                            all the stakeholders accord their concurrence & acceptance to the
                                            success of the transaction? These are questions that need to be
                                            answered for a wider adoption of Blockchain as a technology backbone in
                                            corporate applications.</p>

                                            So, from a corporate sector view of the adoption of Blockchain, the
                                            challenge is to convince the sector on the added layers of security the
                                            technology brings in and the suitability of adoption of Blockchain for
                                            specific areas of business which can not only add security but can help
                                            in elevating the end user experience.</p>

                                            Here in India, the Central Government and most of the State Governments
                                            are promoting BlockChain Technology among various Govt establishments &
                                            departments but there seem to be a lack of awareness on the
                                            possibilities of this technology. The concern for them is that this
                                            technology is something very new, something which is not proven and
                                            validated internationally and have to show the credentials of being the
                                            securest way to store and access data. So, the need is for a clearer
                                            and transparent IT Strategy on adoption of Blockchain and educate the
                                            users on the benefits of the same.</p>

                                            That raises the question of how Blockchain can be a selling point to

                                            just happening and more importantly, what is the USP of availing global

                                            Is BlockChain going to be a mere data repository of live data with some
                                            high degree of security & protection or will it remain as a reference

                                            So, from a corporate sector view of the adoption of Blockchain, the
                                            challenge is to convince the sector on the added layers of security the
                                            technology brings in and the suitability of adoption of Blockchain for
                                            specific areas of business which can not only add security but can help

                                            Here in India, the Central Government and most of the State Governments

                                            departments but there seem to be a lack of awareness on the
                                            possibilities of this technology. The concern for them is that this
                                            technology is something very new, something which is not proven and
                                            validated internationally and have to show the credentials of being the
                                            securest way to store and access data. So, the need is for a clearer
                                            and transparent IT Strategy on adoption of Blockchain and educate the
                                            users on the benefits of the same.</p>

                                            That raises the question of how Blockchain can be a selling point to

                                            just happening and more importantly, what is the USP of availing global

                                            Is BlockChain going to be a mere data repository of live data with some
                                            high degree of security & protection or will it remain as a reference

                                            success of the transaction? These are questions that need to be
                                            answered for a wider adoption of Blockchain as a technology backbone in

                                            So, from a corporate sector view of the adoption of Blockchain, the
                                            challenge is to convince the sector on the added layers of security the
                                            technology brings in and the suitability of adoption of Blockchain for
                                            specific areas of business which can not only add security but can help

                                            Here in India, the Central Government and most of the State Governments
                                            are promoting BlockChain Technology among various Govt establishments &
                                            departments but there seem to be a lack of awareness on the
                                            possibilities of this technology. The concern for them is that this
                                            technology is something very new, something which is not proven and
                                            validated internationally and have to show the credentials of being the
                                            securest way to store and access data. So, the need is for a clearer
                                            and transparent IT Strategy on adoption of Blockchain and educate the
